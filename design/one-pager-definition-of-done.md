* Status: Draft

## Introduction

*Why does this document exist?*

The goal of this document is to answer the questions:

* As a developer, when should I consider a chunk of work to be complete?
* As a reviewer, what should I be looking for to verify that a chunk of work is
  complete?

## Definition of work

Work means a contribution to the project, typically code.

## Definition of done

A chunk of work is considered done when the following criteria have been met:

* All code is written
* Code is reviewed and approved
* New behavior is documented in the documentation that will go onto the
  crossplane website
* All error conditions are reported into the log or as an event, as
  appropriate
* Code is tested, ideally in an integration test

## Applying definition of done

The definition of done can be applied in the following ways:

* Pull requests should not be merged until the work contained in them is
  done.
* Issues tracking work should not be closed until the work being tracked
  is done.
